# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

AOC 2021 solutions in haskell

## Running

using the makefile (yeah I could have just made a cabal/stack project, but whatever)

## Deps

Mostly haskell packages, I tried to use as few as possible, and none of the solutions themselves should be using any.

- utf8-string (used to decode inputs)
- http-client (used to get inputs)
- http-client-tls
- http-types
